Lucata Pathfinder Execution
============

Following our workflow guide for the Lucata Pathfinder platform, you will normally work through the following phases:
1) Running code on an x86 machine with the memoryweb library
2) Running code in untimed and timed mode using the simulator, emusim.
3) Running code on a single node of the Pathfinder system
4) Running code on multiple **nodes** within a single chassis.
5) Running code on multiple **chassis**.

Here we go through the last 3 steps in more detail.
