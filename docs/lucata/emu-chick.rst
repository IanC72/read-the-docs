Emu Chick (Legacy System)
============

We highly recommend using the Lucata Pathfinder platform, which supersedes the Emu Chick. However, we have placed some relevant documentation here for your reference. 

* **karrawingi-login.crnch.gatech.edu**: The main EMU Chick node, used for login and transferring files to a specific node/set of nodes. **NOTE:** You cannot run any code on this node and will need to copy your code to n0-n7 on the Emu Chick machine.
