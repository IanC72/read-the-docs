Lucata Pathfinder Getting Started
============

The Rogues Gallery hosts two systems from Lucata (formerly known as Emu Technology): The Gen1 Emu Chick, an 8-node desktop-style system, and the Lucata Pathfinder, a two-chassis system with 16 nodes and 24 cores in each node for a total of 384 cores. We currently also have 2 Pathfinder chassis on loan from Lucata, which are denoted as PF<2-3>.

Latest Updates
-------------
* Slurm will be deployed in Summer 2022.

Using the EMU simulation and compiler tools
-------------

The current toolset, documentation, and examples are available on the rg-emu-dev VM and other nodes as a module. Note that the Pathfinder currently requires the use of the latest 22.02 tools.


* **rg-login.crnch.gatech.edu**: primary login VM for Rogueâ€™s Gallery. Use this VM to log in to another node for testing and simulation from off campus.
* **rg-emu-dev.crnch.gatech.edu**: VM for **Lucata compilation and simulation**
* **pf<0-1>.crnch.gatech.edu**: Lucata pathfinder chassis for HW execution
* **karrawingi-login.crnch.gatech.edu**: The main EMU Chick node, used
  for login and transferring files to a specific node/set of nodes.
**NOTE:** You cannot run any code on this node and will need to copy your code to n0-n7 on the Emu machine. 

Lucata Workflow

When getting started, we highly recommend checking out the `Lucata Pathfinder Programming Manual <https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/rg-lucata-pathfinder/blob/main/docs/pathfinder/Lucata-Pathfinder-Programming-Guide-v2.0.0-2202-tools.pdf>`__ (*requires GT Github login*) and read through Chapters 1,2,3, 5.1, 6, and 7. This will give you a basic understanding of the Cilk-based workflow and Lucata-specific APIs and tools. 

As shown in the figure above, the suggested Lucata workflow combines 1) x86 functionality testing, 2) simulation of code on a VM, 3) execution on a single node of the Pathfinder system, and 4) execution on multiple nodes and chassis.

1. Compile your code on rg-emud-dev using <memoryweb.h>  and emu-cc.sh to target x86 execution. This will run the Cilk code and emulate any data allocations specified by the Lucata APIs.
2. Simulate code on rg-emu-dev. Do debugging and initial verification here but note that simulation is slow! If you need to use a machine with more memory you can use hawksbill.crnch.gatech.edu
3. Profile your code with the simulator for small input sets.
4. Make a reservation on the Google Calendar for the Pathfinder to run jobs. We also use our Slack channel to reserve time on the Pathfinder 
5. Run your job on a single Pathfinder node (**SN<0-7>**. Verify its correctness.
6. Run your job on a single Pathfinder chassis (8 nodes PF<0-1>).
7. Run your job on multiple Pathfinder chassis (2 chassis).


Tutorials and Training
-------------

Please check out the recent `PEARC21 tutorial <https://github.com/gt-crnch-rg/pearc-tutorial-2021>`__
for official training material for the Pathfinder systems. There are also some examples and related tools 
shared in a Github repo at https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/emu-common.
Please feel free to branch and fork as makes sense for your research.

Eric Hein has also contributed a nice micro-benchmark that uses serial
and recursive spawn. `Micro benchmark <https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/emu-microbench>`__
