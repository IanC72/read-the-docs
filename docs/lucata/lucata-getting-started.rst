Lucata Pathfinder Getting Started
============

The Rogues Gallery hosts two systems from Lucata (formerly known as Emu Technology): The Gen1 Emu Chick, an 8-node desktop-style system, and the Lucata Pathfinder, a two-chassis system with 16 nodes and 24 cores in each node for a total of 384 cores. 


Using the EMU simulation and compiler tools
-------------

The current toolset, documentation, and examples are available on the
login and emu-dev VMs under ``/usr/local/emu/`` for the current
most-stable version. Other versions are available under ``/tools/emu``.
Eric Hein has also written a nice README.

| rg-login.crnch.gatech.edu: primary login VM for Rogueâ€™s Gallery. Use
  for **Emu compilation and simulation**
| rg-emu-dev.crnch.gatech.edu: VM for **Emu compilation and simulation**
| karrawingi-login.crnch.gatech.edu (emuscb): The main EMU node, used
  for login and transferring files to a specific node/set of nodes.
  **NOTE:** You cannot run any code on this node and will need to copy
  your code to n0-n7 on the Emu machine. 

Typical usage model:

1. Compile and simulate code on rg-emu-dev. Do debugging and
   initial verification here but note that simulation is slow!

2. Copy your .mwx file and any inputs to karrawingi-login and then to a
   specific Emu node (n0-n7).

3. Run your code natively on n0 (multinode) or any of n0-n7
   (single-node).

Tutorials and Training
-------------

Please check out the recent `PEARC21 tutorial <https://github.com/gt-crnch-rg/pearc-tutorial-2021>`__
for official training material for the Pathfinder systems. There are also some examples and related tools 
shared in a Github repo at https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/emu-common.
Please feel free to branch and fork as makes sense for your research.

Eric Hein has also contributed a nice micro-benchmark that uses serial
and recursive spawn. `Micro benchmark <https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/emu-microbench>`__
