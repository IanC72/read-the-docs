Lucata Systems Getting Started
============

There are 

Nodes will be accessible from the VMs only - use rg-login.crnch.gatech.edu as the primary access point.

Since the March 2018 update, the Emu nodes are part of an internal subnet. This means that they are only accessible from the main node,
currently called **karrawingi-login.crnch.gatech.edu**. You will have a
local user account on each emu node, and you can access these nodes via
**karrawingi-login**. For more information on logging in, please see the
common questions
`page <https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/rogues-docs/wiki/EMU-Common-User-Questions>`__.

Using the EMU simulation and compiler tools
===========================================

The current toolset, documentation, and examples are available on the
login and emu-dev VMs under ``/usr/local/emu/`` for the current
most-stable version. Other versions are available under ``/tools/emu``.
Eric Hein has also written a nice README.

| rg-login.crnch.gatech.edu: primary login VM for Rogueâ€™s Gallery. Use
  for **Emu compilation and simulation**
| rg-emu-dev.crnch.gatech.edu: VM for **Emu compilation and simulation**
| karrawingi-login.crnch.gatech.edu (emuscb): The main EMU node, used
  for login and transferring files to a specific node/set of nodes.
  **NOTE:** You cannot run any code on this node and will need to copy
  your code to n0-n7 on the Emu machine. 

Typically usage model:

1. Compile and simulate code on rg-login or rg-emu-dev. Do debugging and
   initial verification here but note that simulation is slow!

2. Copy your .mwx file and any inputs to karrawingi-login and then to a
   specific Emu node (n0-n7).

3. Run your code natively on n0 (multinode) or any of n0-n7
   (single-node).

Singularity image
-----------------

The tools also are wrapped in a
`Singularity <https://www.sylabs.io/docs/>`__ image, but this is only
needed if you want to run the tools on your local machine. If one is
available for a toolchain, it will be in /tools/emu/singularity. See
this
`page <https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/rogues-docs/wiki/%5BEmu%5D-Emu-toolchain-Singularity-image>`__
for more details on using this image. Note you can copy the image to
other systems, *e.g.* your laptop, but do not distribute it to outside
people.

Common Emu examples and tools
=============================

We have placed some examples for using the Emu as well as related tools
in a Github repo at https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/emu-common.
Please feel free to branch and fork as makes sense for your research.

| Eric Hein has also contributed a nice micro-benchmark that uses serial
  and recursive spawn.

  benchmark <https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/emu-microbench>`__

Where do I get more assistance?
===============================


-  Emu has also started an official `community
   forum <http://www.emutechnology.com/community/>`__.

I think that I have found a bug to report to Emu!
=================================================

First of all, please try to create a minimum working example (MWE) that
replicates the problem you are seeing with detailed output and limited
extraneous code. Right now, we have a few people who can post issues
with the emusolutions tracker, so it might be best to go through them:
Eric Hein, Jason Riedy, Jeff Young can all post to the tracker. Please
also feel free to discuss via the mailing list once you have an MWE to
illustrate the problem.

================

-  CilkPlus can also be run on CPU-based clusters. For more information
   on general CilkPlus check out the official
   `website <https://www.cilkplus.org/>`__ and other `Cilk
   tutorials <http://faculty.knox.edu/dbunde/teaching/cilk/>`__.

-  See our Kokkos
   `branch <https://github.com/jyoung3131/kokkos/tree/cilkplus>`__
   focused on CilkPlus and eventually on an Emu backend. For more

   documentation.
