# Nengo Getting Started

(This documentation is a work in progress!)

## What useful tutorials and training is there for Nengo users?

## Using Nengo with CRNCH

1. Logging into the CRNCH RG testbed and accessing the rg-neuro VM (rg-ood.crnch.gatech.edu)
2. Installing nengo using pip and virtualenv.
    <ul>
        <li> Access the terminal in the virtual environment.
        <li> Nengo should already be installed using the neuro environment. If not, run the command pip install nengo.
        <li> Navigate to the directory where you want to save the nengo files.
        <li> Inside the terminal run the command "nengo"
    </ul>
3. Running a basic Nengo example - what is the "Hello World" for Nengo. We can use exisitng repos and examples and demonstrate how to run them on our cluster.

## Using Nengo-Gui and Nengo with Notebooks

Log in using CRNCH RG Open OnDemand and get a desktop node to use Nengo-Gui

Alternatively you can use Nengo with a Jupyter notebook on rg-neuro-dev!

## Using Nengo with GPUs

- Does the GPU backend still work? Can we share an example of how to use it?
