This page details how to use `cuQuantum <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuquantum-sdk>`__ on NVIDIA GPUs within the CRNCH Rogues Gallery. cuQuantum specifically is focused on accelerating state vector and tensor network simulations while QODA is a higher-level framework and API that is targeted toward hybrid quantum-classical computing (think like a CPU+QPU rather than a CPU+GPU).
