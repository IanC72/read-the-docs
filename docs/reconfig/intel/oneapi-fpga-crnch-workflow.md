# Using Intel OneAPI with CRNCH Rogues Gallery

Here we will detail how to run one of the Intel OneAPI samples as a guide for how to use the Intel FPGAs on the CRNCH Rogues Gallery.

## General Workflow

1) Evaluate for functional correctness: Build your design for CPU and then for FPGA emulation
2) Check mapping to your target board: Look at the optimization report to see if your design fits.
3) Build a bitstream
4) Run the bitstream on your target board.
5) Profile your bitstream. 

## FPGA Emulation

## Simulation with ModelSim and Questa
Right now we don't think we support this.

## Investigating the Optimization Report

## Building an FPGA Bitstream

## Profiling on FPGA with vTune 
This may be a more advanced topic that we will add at a later date.
