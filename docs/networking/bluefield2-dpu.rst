Bluefield-2 DPU
=============

NVIDIA's Bluefield-2 is the second generation of their Data Processing Unit (DPU) card which has both a high-speed InfiniBand/Ethernet interconnect and on-board DRAM and Arm CPU cores. Notably, this is one of the first SmartNIC devices that can run an on-board operating system in "host" mode.
