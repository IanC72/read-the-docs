Open OnDemand
=============

With the arrival of Slurm scheduling for most resources, we have switched to using Open OnDemand for GUI and notebook interfaces. `Open On Demand <https://openondemand.org/>`__ provides a web browser interface from which users can launch GUI-based applications including Jupyter notebooks, file browsers,
command-line terminals, and VNC-based applications. We encourage you to review the `general PACE instructions <https://docs.pace.gatech.edu/ood/guide/>`__ for more details on what you can do with OOD - this page covers RG-specific tasks that you might find useful.
