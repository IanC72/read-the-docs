Open OnDemand (GUI interfaces)
=============

With the arrival of Slurm scheduling for most resources, we have switched to using Open OnDemand for GUI and notebook interfaces. `Open On Demand <https://openondemand.org/>`__ provides a web browser interface from which users can launch GUI-based applications including Jupyter notebooks, file browsers,
command-line terminals, and VNC-based applications.
