===================
Python Environments
===================

- The default Python is typically 3.8. We do not officially support Python 2 usage as most packages have updated to support Python 3.
    - Look into `2to3 <https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html>`__ if your code is still using Python 2!
- :code:`virtualenv` is installed across most of our servers and as many dev boards as possible.
    - We recommend to use either :code:`virtualenv` or :code:`venv` with :code:`pip` or :code:`pipenv` to install packages into your local virtual environments. Note that :code:`venv` and :code:`pip` are default packages for all Python 3.3+ installations.
- We do not typically recommend using conda, miniconda, or anaconda as these quickly eat up home directory space. 
    - However, if you want to use conda or miniconda please consider `using miniconda with your scratch space folder <https://gt-crnch-rg.readthedocs.io/en/main/general/rg-filesystems.html>`__ to store your conda environment and venvs.
    
What's the difference between pip, venv, env, conda, etc?

Using venv on CRNCH RG
======================
Venv is the default virtual environment module included since Python 3.3, and it totally replaces `pyenv` since Python 3.6. Virtualenv has many similarities to venv in terms of its functionality, but we recommend using venv unless you need to use a version of Python older than 3.3.

Pip
==============

Conda
===================
**Note:** We typically don't recommend using anaconda due to the amount of dependencies it pulls into your home directory. If you get to where you need anaconda for a project this is typically some software that should be installed in a project space or system-wide!

Resources with more details on conda:

- `Understanding conda and pip <https://www.anaconda.com/blog/understanding-conda-and-pip>`__
- `Explaining the many flavors of conda <https://whiteboxml.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-python-virtual-environments-with-conda>`__
- `OLCF's guide to using conda, which assumes a sitewide installation of conda <https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/software/python/conda_basics.html>`__.
- `NERSC's guide on using python with anaconda <https://docs.nersc.gov/development/languages/python/>`__

Poetry
===============
Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging similar to pipenv (which combines pip and venv). While we don't currently support it, you may be interested to try it out in your user-local setup. Read more about Poetry at the `official website <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`__.

Bonus: IPython, IPykernel, and Jupyter
======================================
You may see some reference to IPython kernels which switching between virtual environments or especially for Jupyter notebooks. In short, IPython (`see site <https://ipython.org/>`__) is a command shell for interactive Python execution that can be extended for GUI applications and parallel computing. Jupyter is a web-based interactive tool that builds on IPython but also supports many other kernels for languages like Julia and R. You can read more about kernels for Jupyter `at this link <https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/kernels.html>`__.
