We welcome and appreciate your comments and contributions to this documentation.

What is the process for contributing documentation?
########
To contribute documentation, you should write an rst-formatted file related to your topic and submit it via `pull request to this repository <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`_.

What should my documentation contain?

1) A useful title
* Ex: "Compiling ROS for the AC701 FPGA platform"

2) A brief description of the problem you're trying to solve.
* Ex: "This documentation details how to compile ROS for AC701 using the flubber server".

3) 

Where should I add new files?
