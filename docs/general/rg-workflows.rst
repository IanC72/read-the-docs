Rogues Gallery Workflows
========================

*This page is currently a work in progress!*

Novel and post-Moore architectures typically have a specific workflow
that incorporate some aspect of simulation or "emulation" before running
on actual hardware. In a sense, this is because novel architectures are
typically challenging to program or have some beta features that may
crash when running a full program.

This page provides a guide for the general "suggested" workflows to be
productive on the Rogues Gallery. Most of these workflows incorporate
the usage of our Slurm job scheduler to request and use physical
resources like servers and FPGAs.
