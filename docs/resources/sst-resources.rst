Scalable Simulation Toolkit Resources
=====================================

What do you need to know as background for using SST?
*****************************************************

- Basic understanding of computer architecture
- Experience with C and C++ coding. Please see `this link for useful resources to learn C++ <https://github.com/gt-crnch-rg/fc-with-rg-vip/blob/main/resources/development/%5BDevelopment%5D-Resources-C-Plus-Plus.md>`__. 


Tutorials and Training
**********************

- `Sandia SST Tutorials <http://sst-simulator.org/SSTPages/SSTTopDocTutorial/>`__ - shares a list of several recent SST tutorials
- `Tactical Computing Laboratories (TCL) Fork of SST Tutorial <https://github.com/tactcomplabs/sst-tutorials>`__ - this is a slightly newer version of the standard SST tutorial released in 2021-2022.

Using SST with Singularity
**************************

TCL has created an initial container build of SST using Singularity that is available in an open-source fashion. This section details how you can use these containers to start running locally, on CRNCH, and on Georgia Tech's large HPC infrastructure, PACE Phoenix. We highly suggest you look at their container tutorial which can be found `at this page <https://github.com/jleidel/sst-documentation/blob/Level3Container/Tutorials/Containers.md>`__.

RISC-V with SST
*********************
There are currently two options for simulating RISC-V style cores in SST:

- Vanadis
- Rev

Modeling HW Accelerators with SST
*********************************
TBD
