What is GraphBLAS?
*****************
GraphBLAS is a graph-oriented version of linear algebra routines.

There are a wide variety of resources `GraphBLAS-Pointers repo <https://github.com/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Pointers>`__. The following listed resources (with stars) are likely the best place to start.
