Introduction to FPGAs and Reconfigurable Computing
-----------------------------------------------------

What are FPGAs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FPGAs are integrated circuits that can be reconfigured post-manufacturing to suit specific tasks. They're like a blank canvas where you can design your own digital circuits.

Why use FPGAs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

They offer flexibility (can be reprogrammed), can be highly parallel, and often provide better performance per watt compared to traditional processors for certain tasks. FPGA stands for field programmable gate array, which essentially means it's a semiconductor device that can be programmed after manufacturing to implement numerous digital circuit designs, allowing developers to customize its functionality to fit a wide range of applications.
